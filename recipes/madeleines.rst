If you want beautifully “mountain”-shaped madeleines, bake them in (mini) muffin pans; put the paper baking cups in the pans and then pour the dough).
Do not open the oven while the madeleines are in (if you do, the madeleines will deflate).

1. Preheat oven at 190ºC.

2. Beat eggs and sugar together in a large bowl. Add in oil, milk, a sprinkle of ground cinnamon, grated lemon peel, sifted flour and baking powder; mix.

3. Pour the dough into the individual baking cups; fill them up to 3/4. Sprinkle some sugar on the madeleines.

4. Bake at 190ºC for about 25 minutes, until golden brown.
