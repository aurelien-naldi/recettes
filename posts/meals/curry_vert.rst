Ingredients
===========

* 1 cup of coriander leaves
* 2 tablespoons ginger
* 1 red onion/shallot
* 2 lime kaffir leaves
* 2 green chillis
* 2 teaspoons of cumin
* 1 medium sized can of coconut milk
* 1.5 cups of stock
* Various vegetables.

method:
Cut up the coriander leaves and the chillis (deseed if you require a mild curry), and mix together with the cummin and the ginger and a tiny bit of water, to make a paste. Dice the shallot, and fry for thirty seconds in a little peanut oil. Add the curry paste and fry until fragrant, at which point add the coconut milk and the stock. Allow to simmer on low for a few minutes. Then add the vegetables in usual cooking order, and simmer on low, stirring occasionally, until they're all cooked through.

I added (in this order) (and prepared appropriately): potatoes, capsicum, snake beans, brocolli, bok choy, and bean shoots.
