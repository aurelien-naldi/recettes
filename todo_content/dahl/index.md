summary: soupe de lentilles
---

* half cup green (or yellow) lentils
* half cup red lentils
* half cup yellow split peas

* 1 shallot (diced)
* ginger (about three cm worth) (diced)
* 2 cloves garlic (diced)
* green chillis (thin slices)
* 3 tomatoes (diced well)
* 2 cups vegetable stock
* 1 tablespoon ground coriander seeds
* 1 tablespoon ground cumin
* 2 teaspoon tumeric
* 1 can coconut cream


Soak the lentils and peas for six to eight hours. Drain, rinse well, and remove any funny looking bits.

Fry shallot, ginger and garlic until the shallot is clear, then add spices and chilli and fry until the spices are fragrant. Add peas and lentils and tomatoes, stir, add the stock. Simmer, covered, for about fifty minutes, or until the lentils are soft, stirring occasionally and adding water as necessary.

Add the coconut milk, stir through, simmer for another five minutes, then leave to sit (on the burner, but with the heat off) for another two or three minutes.

Serve with roti and rice. The roti will obviously not be gluten-free.

chilli note: two chillis for a mild flavour; four chillis for a bit of spice.
